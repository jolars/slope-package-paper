\begin{letter}{Journal of Statistical Software}
  \opening{Dear Editor,}

  We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled ``Efficient Solvers for SLOPE
  in R, Python, Julia, and C++'' for consideration for publication in the
  Journal of Statistical Software.

  This paper presents a comprehensive suite of software packages implementing
  efficient solvers for Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) across four
  programming languages: R, Python, Julia, and C++. The packages support
  generalized linear models with various loss functions and handle diverse data
  structures including dense, sparse, and out-of-memory matrices. Our
  implementation features a highly efficient hybrid coordinate descent
  algorithm and we provide comprehensive benchmarks to showcase its performance
  as well as instructive examples on how to use our software in practice.

  We believe this work makes a significant contribution to the statistical
  software community by providing high-quality, well-documented, and performant
  implementations of SLOPE that are readily accessible across multiple
  programming environments. The packages are already available through standard
  package repositories (CRAN, PyPI, and the Julia General Registry) and have
  been designed with reproducibility and ease of use in mind.

  The submission includes the complete manuscript, all source code for the
  packages, and replication materials that allow readers to
  reproduce all figures and results presented in the paper.

  We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not
  under consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved the
  manuscript and agree with its submission to JSS.

  Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to your feedback.

  \closing{Yours sincerely,\\[1ex]
    Johan Larsson, Ma\l{}gorzata Bogdan, Krystyna Grzesiak, Mathurin Massias, and Jonas Wallin
